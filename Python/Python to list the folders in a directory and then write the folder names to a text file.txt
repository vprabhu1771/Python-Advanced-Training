Certainly! You can use the `os` module in Python to list the folders in a directory and then write the folder names to a text file. Here's a simple script for that:

```python
import os

def write_folder_names_to_txt(directory_path, output_file_path):
    try:
        # Get a list of folder names in the specified directory
        folder_names = [folder for folder in os.listdir(directory_path) if os.path.isdir(os.path.join(directory_path, folder))]

        # Write the folder names to a text file
        with open(output_file_path, 'w') as output_file:
            for folder_name in folder_names:
                output_file.write(folder_name + '\n')

        print(f"Folder names written to {output_file_path} successfully.")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

# Replace 'path/to/your/directory' with the path of the directory you want to scan
directory_path = 'path/to/your/directory'

# Replace 'output.txt' with the desired name for the output text file
output_file_path = 'output.txt'

# Call the function with the specified directory and output file paths
write_folder_names_to_txt(directory_path, output_file_path)
```

Make sure to replace the `'path/to/your/directory'` with the actual path of the directory you want to scan, and `'output.txt'` with the desired name for the output text file.

This script uses the `os.listdir` method to get a list of all items in the specified directory, and then filters out only the folders using `os.path.isdir`. The folder names are then written to the specified text file line by line.

Remember to handle file paths carefully and make sure you have the necessary permissions to read from the directory and write to the text file.
