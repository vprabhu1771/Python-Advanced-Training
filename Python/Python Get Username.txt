To get the current username in Python, you can use the `getpass` module or the `os` module. Here are two examples:

### Using `getpass` module:

```python
import getpass

username = getpass.getuser()
print("Current username:", username)
```

### Using `os` module:

```python
import os

username = os.getlogin()
print("Current username:", username)
```

Note that the `getpass.getuser()` function may not work as expected in all environments, especially if the username is not set or if the program is running with elevated privileges. The `os.getlogin()` function attempts to get the login name associated with the controlling terminal, which might be more reliable in some cases.

Choose the method that best suits your requirements based on the context in which you are using it.
