Certainly! If you want each year to be enclosed in parentheses and separated by a comma, you can modify the code as follows:

```python
# Create a tuple containing the years from 1900 to 2023
years_tuple = tuple(range(1900, 2024))

# Format the tuple elements as strings with parentheses and commas
formatted_years = ",".join(f"({year})" for year in years_tuple)

# Specify the file name
file_name = "output.txt"

# Write the formatted string to the file
with open(file_name, "w") as file:
    file.write(formatted_years)

print(f"Formatted tuple exported to {file_name}")
```

In this code, the `formatted_years` line uses a generator expression to format each year as a string with parentheses, and the `join` method joins these strings with commas. The rest of the code is similar to the previous example. This will result in a file containing a string like `(1900),(1901),(1902),...(2022),(2023)`.
