If you want to determine the operating system version using Python, you can use the `platform` module. Here's an example:

```python
import platform

# Get the operating system name
os_name = platform.system()

# Get the operating system version
os_version = platform.version()

# Print the results
print(f"Operating System: {os_name}")
print(f"Operating System Version: {os_version}")
```

This will print information about the operating system, such as "Windows" for Windows operating systems, and a version string specific to the operating system.

Please note that the version information might not be very detailed or might not provide exactly what you're looking for, especially if you want to specifically identify Windows 10 or a similar version. In that case, you might need to use additional methods or libraries, such as the `platform.win32_ver()` function, to get more detailed information on Windows systems.
