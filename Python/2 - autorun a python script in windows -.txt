To convert the given code using the `subprocess` module, you can use `subprocess.run` to execute the `copy` command. Here's the modified code:

```python
import subprocess
from getpass import getuser
import os

user_name = getuser()

startup = 'C:\\Users\\{}\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup'.format(user_name)

# Use subprocess.run to execute the copy command
subprocess.run(["copy", __file__, startup], shell=True)

print("\a")
```

In this code snippet, `subprocess.run` is used to execute the `copy` command. The `shell=True` parameter is set to allow the use of shell commands. Note that `shell=True` can introduce security risks if the `__file__` variable contains user input, as it may lead to shell injection vulnerabilities. If you're working with user input, it's recommended to validate and sanitize the input before using it in a command.
